with BankAccountDAO testing, we have to ensure the following functions will be executed correctly:
Get method:
    1:Get Account by a given account Number
    2. The method get will output null value if no account exists
Update method:
    3. update an account existing in the database
    4. update an account which doest not exist in the database
    5. create (and update) an account which is not already in the database
with TransactionDAO testing:
    6. save a transaction
    7. get the list of an account's transactions which is executed
    8. get the list of an account's transactions which is executed in an interval of time
    9. get the list of n closest transactions
