with DAO testing, we have to ensure the following functions will be executed correctly:
Get method:
    1:Get Account by a given account Number
    2:Get account by a give id
    3.Get the whole list from the database
Update method:
    1. update an account existing in the database
    2. create (and update) an account which is not already in the database
Delete method:
    1. Delete an account by ID, account number
    2. Delete the whole rows in a table
